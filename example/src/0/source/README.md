# Gitorial Example

Gitorial is a tutorial format built on top of Git history.

Each learning step is represented as a meaningful change, so code evolution stays explicit and reviewable.

In this example:

- `template` shows TODO-driven starter code
- `solution` shows the completed step
- `section` pages provide context without code snapshots
